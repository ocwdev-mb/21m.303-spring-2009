Analyze the key relationships in Gretchen am Spinnrade. What is the harmony at the climax ("Und ach! sein Kuß!")? How does Schubert arrive at this chord?

Familiarize yourself with Schubert, Die schöne Müllerin, nos. 7-10. Remember always to compare the text with the music. How well does strophic form capture the expressive qualities of the poetry? What makes the music expressive, in spite of the repetition?

Familiarize yourself with songs 7, 8, and 10 in Die Schöne Müllerin. Analyze the harmony, phrase structure, relationship between the text and the music. In 'Ungeduld,' how does Schubert convey an impression of impatience? In 'Moregengruss,' what is the function of the chromatic harmonies in mm. 12-15? In 'Thränenregen,' how do you explain Schubert's different treatment of the last stanza?

Begin identifying potential texts for your song composition. You will need to bring 2 choices to the next class. You may choose from the sample romantic poems provided, or simply use these as models for your own choices

Begin work on your song. Sketch parts of your vocal line and ideas for a piano accompaniment. Write a piano introduction

In addition, familiarize yourself with Schumann's Dichterliebe, Nos. 1-7. You'll find that the songs are full of enigma: What key is the first song in? Where do phrases end in song 2 _(Aus meinen Tra{{< resource "709093a2-8554-99fb-ca36-ab83c1ab3501" >}} en sprießen)?_ Where is the climax in song 4 _(Wenn ich in deine Augen seh')_? What is the opening chord in song 5 _(Ich will meine Seele tauchen)_, and what is its effect? What modifications does Schumann make to Heine's poem in Song 7 _(Ich grolle nicht)_ and what effect does this have on the musical form?
